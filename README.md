## Assignment Overview
This assignment involves analyzing the *Airline On-Time Data* dataset from the Data Expo 2009. The dataset provides detailed records of airline flight delays and on-time performances, allowing for the exploration of trends in air travel efficiency. Through this analysis, we aim to identify patterns, evaluate factors contributing to flight delays, and develop predictive models for future airline operations.
